FINISH THE SONG (everyone 4 verses: every second word of every verse italic, every NEVER bold)


We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

I *just* wanna tell you how i'm feeling
Gotta *make* you understand!

**Never** *gonna* give you up
**Never** *gonna* let you down

**Never** *gonna* run *around* and *desert* you
**Never** *gonna* make *you* cry

**Never** *gonna* say goodbye
**Never** *gonna* tell a lie and hurt you

We've *known* each other for so long
Your *heart's* been aching but you're too shy to say it
